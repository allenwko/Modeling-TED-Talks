# Modeling TED Talks

Hi! I've used NLP to compare TED Talks to Yale Open lectures, with some interesting results. I was able to find an interesting "TED Vector" with LSA, which showed a lot of difference between TED Talks and Yale lectures. Please check out the presentation and code for more details!


The presentation is the PDF in the base folder. IPython notebooks containing the raw Python code used for scraping and modeling are in the iPython folder. The Flask app that can be used to serve the model is just in the base directory. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions! allenwko@gmail.com
